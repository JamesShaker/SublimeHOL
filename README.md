HOL for Sublime Text
=====================================

A HOL ITP (https://hol-theorem-prover.org/) development environment built on top of slimmed down, heavily modified versions of SublimeREPL (https://github.com/wuub/SublimeREPL), SublimeANSI (https://github.com/aziz/SublimeANSI), and SML-syntax (https://github.com/Takaia/SML-syntax) put together.

Installation
-------------
* You must have HOL installed and accessible through the command ``hol``
* Install the ``HOL`` package from PackageControl (https://packagecontrol.io/)
* OR clone this repository into your Packages folder and **rename it to HOL**

Usage
-------
* ``HOL`` submenu under Tools in Sublime for all the operations and their keybindings
* A right click context menu exists to kill/restart the REPL and send signals including SIGINT
* For more details and more control please see the key bindings and preference files available under the preferences menu
* Note: The terminal is speedy enough for interactive use but large imports should be done in quiet mode as they
can take some time to colourise!
